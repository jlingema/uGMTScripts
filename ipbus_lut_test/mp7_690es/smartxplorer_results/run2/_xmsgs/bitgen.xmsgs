<msg type="info" file="Bitgen" num="40" delta="old" >Replacing &quot;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">Auto</arg>&quot; with &quot;<arg fmt="%s" index="2">NoWait</arg>&quot; for option &quot;<arg fmt="%s" index="3">Match_cycle</arg>&quot;.  Most commonly, bitgen has determined and will use a specific value instead of the generic command-line value of &quot;Auto&quot;.  Alternately, this message appears if the same option is specified multiple times on the command-line.  In this case, the option listed last will be used.

This design contains one or more IP cores that use separately licensed
features. If the design has been configured to make use of evaluation
features, please note that these features will cease to function after a
certain period of time. Please consult the core datasheet to determine
whether the core which you have configured will be affected. Evaluation
features should NOT be used in production systems.
