uGMTScripts
===========
Testing software for the CMS uGMT.

This repository contains a script collection for testing and configurating the uGMT. It is partly dependent on a setup of CMSSW and uhal.

The development was taken over by @thomreis and any potential new users should therefore use [his fork](https://github.com/thomreis/uGMTScripts) as a base.
